# C# R.A.T Client
This is the client version of the c# R.A.T  
This will run on the target's machine and will connect to your machine via Tcp/IP  
You will need to download [R.A.T Server](https://github.com/AdvancedHacker101/C-Sharp-R.A.T-Server) to your computer to accept incoming clients  
The project depedns on .NET Framework, and windows.  
**Planning to extend to various platforms like:**  
- Android
- Linux
- Browser (Chrome, IE, And Firefox via browser extensions)
- HTTP Server (via php backdoors)

Some of the R.A.T Features are:  
- Keylogger
- Remote Desktop
- Mic And Cam Spy
- Remote Cmd Prompt
- Process and File manager
- Fun Menu (hiding Desktop icons, Clock, Taskbar, showing messagebox, triggering windows sound effects)
- DDoS with target validation
- Password manager (supporting: Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox)

Firefox password harvesting depends on NirSoft password fox.  
Other two browsers are implemented in the code.  
**I plan to add more features like:**
- [ ] Scripting (for automating attacks)
- [ ] Dns Server spoofing using [c# Dns Server] (https://github.com/AdvanceHacker101/c-sharp-Dns-Server)
- [ ] Proxy Server (for web content modification)
- [ ] Pivoting (infecting other machines in the local network)
- [ ] Registry editing
- [ ] Windows System password phising attack
- [ ] Probing methods (for ex. start at system start, prevent from deleting file, maybe get UAC elevated)
- [x] Option to hide program on start
- [ ] Maybe http/s server for browser clients
- [ ] Dynamic Client Builder (for people who don't understand the code really good) + support for resolving Dns to ipv4 address

And only use this on other peoples machine if you have thier permission, otherwise you can test it on a VW (Virtul Machine)  
This is not a dangerous virus so if you start it on your own machine and don't send any commands from the server you can safely just close the program like nothing happend  

*Happy Coding!*
